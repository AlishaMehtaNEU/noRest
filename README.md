# Animal Adoption noREST project 
Animals are in need of a second chance.There are not enough homes for all the animals that are born every year. Adopting from a shelter helps weaken the pet overpopulation cycle. Each year 8 to 12 million dogs, cats, puppies and kittens are euthanized because there are simply not enough homes for them.Throughout the country, thousands of commercial pet-breeding facilities and backyard breeders produce millions of animals for sale in pet stores and through newspaper ads. Often known as puppy and kitten mills, these facilities repeatedly impregnate female dogs that spend their entire lives in cages without human companionship. These unfortunate animals are often in intolerable environments, forced to produce litter upon litter, and are destroyed after they become unprofitable assets. Adopting a shelter animal means you don’t support such cruel practices.
Considering this problem we have built a website where a user can sign up or login and see animal list.Our system offers a variety that you won’t find anywhere else. We have specific breeds and also the greatest mutts you’ll ever find.User can also ask questions about each animal.User can go through all the events happening in the city for adoption arranged my our Pawfect organization.
