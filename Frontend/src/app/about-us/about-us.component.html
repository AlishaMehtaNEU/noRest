      <h1>An Unwavering Champion for Animals in Need</h1>
      <p class="lead">For 120 years, The Animal Rescue League of Boston (ARL) has responded to the needs of animals and the people who care about them. In fact, we are often the first to respond. With over 540 dedicated volunteers and 100 staff members, ARL lends unwavering support to local animals, families, and neighborhoods.

          We provide outstanding veterinary care, adoption, and field services. We also confront the root causes of animal cruelty and neglect through special police investigation and advocacy aimed at strengthening the laws that protect animals. Last year alone, we served more than 16,900 animals in need.

          Today, we increasingly focus on prevention and the impact we can have on more animals; keeping them out of shelters and in the communities where they belong. This ambitious call to action is reflected in our new vision for the future.

          ARL does not receive any government or public funding and relies solely on the generosity of compassionate individuals to carry out our important work to help animals and communities in need. We ask all those who share our goals to reaffirm a commitment to the future we all hope to achieve. Together, we can make it happen!</p>
